# sudokulator

This is an attempt to create a Killer Sudoku Calculator similar to

https://craigmbooth.com/projects/killer-sudoku-calculator/

but with a better user experience and some extra features.

The simplest and most obvious improvements are:

- No big distracting block of text taking up most of the page forcing the
  user to start interacting with components that drop below the fold
  when you interact

- No annoying dropdowns to access the digits you want to toggle

- A set of optional "must include" digits in addition to the exclude digits
